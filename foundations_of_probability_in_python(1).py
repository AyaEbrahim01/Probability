*   To simulate the outcome of a random experiment.

Then we can check if the results are what we expected. We have two options to configure the generator: using the (**random_state**) parameter of the rvs function or using (**np.random.seed**).

**Flipping coins**

---




This exercise requires the bernoulli object from the scipy.stats library to simulate the two possible outcomes from a coin flip, 1 ("heads") or 0 ("tails"), and the numpy library (loaded as np) to set the random generator seed.

You'll use the bernoulli.rvs() function to simulate coin flips using the size argument.

You will set the random seed so you can reproduce the results for the random experiment in each exercise.

From each experiment, you will get the values of each coin flip. You can add the coin flips to get the number of heads after flipping 10 coins using the sum() function.


---


*Steps:*
1. Import bernoulli from scipy.stats, set the seed with np.random.seed(). Simulate 1 flip, with a 35% chance of heads.
2. Use bernoulli.rvs() and sum() to get the number of heads after 10 coin flips with 35% chance of getting heads.
3. Using bernoulli.rvs() and sum(), try to get the number of heads after 5 flips with a 50% chance of getting heads.
